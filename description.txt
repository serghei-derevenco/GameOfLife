Short description for our project:
1. We have 3 types of cells : Crocodile, Monkey and Chicken.
2. We added some rules for them: 
	a) If Chicken is near with Crocodile, then Crocodile will eat it and wiil go to it's position.
	b) If a Monkey is between 4 Chickens, they will peck it and Monkey will dissapear.
	c) If a Crocodile is between 4 Monkey, they will peck it and Crocodile will dissapear.
3. We added some environments:
	a) Lava - is an environment that kills all type of cells that are instantiating on it.
	b) Banana - is an environment that gives opportunity for cells of type Monkey to appear on it.
	c) Fertile - is an environment where the reproduction is working faster.
	d) And we are checking to not overlapp our randomly generated environments.
4. Every object that appears in our game is instantiated randomly.
5. We added an option to increase or decrease the generatiion interval by pressing Up Arrow or Down Arrow key and also you can see total number of each type of animal.
